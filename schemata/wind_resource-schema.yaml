title: Wind resource description
description: >-
  A description of a location’s wind resource as a probability mass
  function—using relative weights—, possibly using Weibull distributions for
  the wind speed, or as a case.

      The UUID should follow RFC 4122.
      It is meant to distinguish different turbine descriptions.
      This is especially relevant for different versions and variants of the
