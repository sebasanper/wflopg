    description: >-
      It is meant to distinguish different site descriptions.
      This is especially relevant for different versions and variants of the
      same site.

    description: >-
      A list of relevant pieces of information, such as further site
      description and details about the choices made in the ‘parcels’ and
      ‘boundaries’ formulations.

  radius:
    title: Site radius [km]
    description: >-
      This is the radius in km of the smallest disc covering the site. Four
      fractional digits must be given. (Otherwise the trailing significant
      digits are assumed to be 0.) This radius is used to make all site
      distances adimensional and give a single-value indication of its size.
      Specifying distances adimensionally makes it easy to scale sites by just
      changing this property.

  rotor_constraints:
    description: >-
      Whether the site description constrains the tower location or also the
      rotor. If ‘false’, only the tower is constrained. If ‘true’ also the
      rotor is constrained. In the last case, this means the tower must be
      placed at least a rotor radius inside the site away from the boundary.

  constraint:
    title: Quadratic constraint
    description: >-
      A representation of a quadratic constraint in terms of coefficients
      of a quadratic multinomial expression in the coordinate variables
      x and y. These variables form a coordinate pair as described in
      "coordinate-schema.yaml#/definitions/coordinates".
      The expression must be negative (positive) for points inside (outside)
      the site. Points on the border, for which the expression is zero, are
      by default assumed to lie inside the site. (This means that it is assumed
      turbines can be placed on the site border.)
